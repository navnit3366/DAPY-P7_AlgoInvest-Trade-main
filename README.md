# AlgoInvest-Trade

## Description
A quick project regarding algorithms and complexity. Written in Python.

The problem is a 0-1 knapsack problem. 

- bruteforce.py explores all possible combinations of actions across the dataset. Complexity 0(2^n). 

- optimized.py offers the classic resolution by building a m(0...n, 0...W) profit matrix maximizing gain. Greedy approximation is also available, to compare results and discuss its pros and cons.
